= Introduction =

JLyr fetches lyrics from multiple sources, either via an API provided by the website, or by parsing the webpage you would usually see on the web.


= Providers List =


== AZLyrics ==

To get the lyrics from [http://www.azlyrics.com/ AZLyrics]:

  * Search for the lyrics on their site via [http://www.duckduckgo.com/ DuckDuckGo].
  * Parse the web page to find the lyrics.

This relies on [http://www.duckduckgo.com/ DuckDuckGo] for searching for the song on AZLyrics. Failure to find lyrics _might_ be due to !DuckDuckGo not finding them (although this is most likely not the case). I am working on an alternative. Meanwhile, if you find the lyrics on the website but not via the app, please report it.

== !MetroLyrics ==

To get the lyrics from [http://www.metrolyrics.com/ MetroLyrics]:

  * Generate the URL dynamically.
  * Parse the web page to find the lyrics.

This method involves a lot of parsing and might not be fool-proof. If there are any problems displaying the lyrics, or not finding them even  though they are on the website, please report.

== LyrDB ==

To get the lyrics from [http://www.lyrdb.com/ LyrDB]:

  * Search for the song via their API.
  * Get the lyrics directly.

This relies on their API for searching and fetching, so it might "find" a song's lyrics, even if it's not a 100% percent match. (A sanity check will be included in future releases).

Also, I've been noticing that the website is often down. If fetching lyrics is slow, try disabling this source, as it may be slowing down the providers which come after it.

== !ChartLyrics ==

To get the lyrics from [http://www.chartlyrics.com/ ChartLyrics]:

  * Search and get the lyrics directly from !ChartLyrics.

This relies on their API for searching and fetching, so it might "find" a song's lyrics, even if it's not a 100% percent match. (A sanity check will be included in future releases). This is actually happening more frequently than LyrDB: it finds a song that is not near at all.

This one is here for testing. You don't need to use it. It will always fail.
